# Ethan Walker's Token
This token development is based on Updraft.Cyfrin's course [Develop an ERC20 Crypto Curreny](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/advanced-foundry/How-to-create-an-erc20-crypto-currency/erc-and-erc20-fundamentals), and I hope to expand and test it extensively to make it a more comprehensive cryptocurrency, cable of conducting simulated transactions and helping me gain a deeper insight of tokens in Web3.  
  
Everything here deeply excites and amazes me! Sincerely hope to connect with like-minded partners to discuss, progress, and grow together.
